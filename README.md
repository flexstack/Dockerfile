## FlexStack â™¡ Docker

At FlexStack we love the humble Dockerfile. They offer unparalleled flexibility (ðŸ˜‰) and control, allowing you to specify 
exactly how your environment should be built, from the operating system up. This precision ensures that your applications 
run exactly as intended, in any environment, which is critical for reliable deployments.

Unfortunately, Dockerfiles can be boring to write and maintain. They're often verbose, repetitive, and sometimes require a lot of 
boilerplate code. They can also be difficult to get right in terms of security, build performance, and best practices. This repository 
aims to provide a collection of example Dockerfiles for different programming languages and frameworks, to help you get started with your 
own projects.

We hope you find them useful! If you have any suggestions or improvements, please feel free to open an issue or pull request.
